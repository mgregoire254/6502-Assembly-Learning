; Practicing control flow in 6502 assembly.

; Write an assembly snippet that loads the Accumulator with the value 10, 
; then decrements it until it reaches zero or becomes negative. If it becomes negative, branch to a label called negative_value.


; Create a subroutine named multiply_by_two. It should load a value into the Accumulator, double it, and then return.
